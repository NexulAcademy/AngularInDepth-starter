# AngularInDepth-starter

The Angular project built during class should be added in the repo root folder and be called 'simple-crm-cli'

The C# API that will be called in the second half of the class is almost ready to go.  When you build and run the C# API, navigate to /home to see the C# MVC output. An error will appear at the root.

The Angular run output will appear at the localhost root.
